What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
There is a .git folder with metadata. You need to add files using git add <filename> for them to be tracked. You need to do this because
you may not want to track all files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a subset of the set of files in the working directory that you want to commit to the repository. 
Choosing which files to commit may be better for following the idea of one commit per logical change, if the files are logically separate
Also, you may not care to track changes to all files
