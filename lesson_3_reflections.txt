When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  This ensures that you can access your work from multiple locations and also have a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  There may be others working with the repository at the same time and you may not want to merge their changes in automatically.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  You fork a repo on Github when you want to have your own copy on Github that you can modify and control. It also links back to the 
   repo that was forked which gives them credit for the original. Forks operate only on Github.
  You clone a repository to make an identical local copy of it. You can clone either a remote or local repository. You may want to
   clone a fork you just made so you can work on it locally, or you may want to clone a repository to checkout a particular commit.
  You create a branch when you want to make changes independent of another branch.
  
 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
   You have a point of reference to when you modify it,  you have the ability to merge changes from the remote into your local.
    and also if you are going to be offline it may be useful to fetch the remote so you have access to a copy.
