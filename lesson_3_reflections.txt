When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  This ensures that you can access your work from multiple locations and also have a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  There may be others working with the repository at the same time and you may not want to merge their changes in automatically.
